# CulturalES_WildfireRx - Kyle Manley

This is the information page pertaining to the wildfire/Rx impacts to CES project. 

Welcome to the CulturalES_WildfireRx repository, developed as part of Earth Lab and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). This repository is the primary resource for the CIRES VFP project, which focuses on modeling the effects of disturbances and management practices on cultural ecosystem services across the western United States.

## Overview

In this project, I will address the following questions: 
1. How do patterns of CES use, specifically recreation, change after wildfire and Rx in the US West and what are the differences?
2. How does reliance upon/use of CES lead to exposure/vulnerability to wildfire/Rx hazards?
  a. What are the economic consequences of CES change post-fire and are there disparities within economies dependent upon recreation.
  b. How often are recreationists exposed to smoke from wildfires versus Rx and what are the consequences?

## Customize Your Repository

As a new working group, you'll want to make this repository your own. Here's how to get started:

1. **Edit This Readme**: Replace the placeholder content with information about your specific project. Ensure that the introduction, project overview, and objectives clearly reflect your group's research focus.

2. **Update Bio**: Add details about your expertise, role in the project, and professional background. Include links to personal or professional web pages to foster community engagement and collaboration.

3. **Organize Your Code**: Structure your codebase in a way that is logical and accessible. Use directories and clear naming conventions to make it easy for all members to find and contribute to different parts of the project.

4. **Document Your Data**: Include a data directory with README files explaining the datasets, sources, and any preprocessing steps. This will help new members understand and work with the project's data effectively.

5. **Outline Your Methods**: Create a detailed METHODS.md file where you describe the methodologies, software, and tools you will be using in your research. This transparency will support reproducibility and collaborative development.

6. **Set Up Project Management**: Utilize the 'Issues' and 'Projects' features on GitHub to track tasks, discuss ideas, and manage your workflow. This can help in maintaining a clear view of progress and priorities.

7. **Add a License**: Choose and include an appropriate open-source license for your project, ensuring that the broader community understands how they can use and contribute to your work.

8. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Establish a CONTRIBUTING.md file with instructions for members on how to propose changes, submit issues, and contribute code.

9. **Review and Merge Workflow**: Decide on a workflow for reviewing and merging changes. Will you use branch protection? Who will have merge privileges? Document this process to avoid confusion.

10. **Establish Communication Channels**: Beyond GitHub, set up additional communication channels like Slack, Discord, or email lists for quick and informal discussions.

Remember, the goal is to make your repository clear, accessible, and useful for all current and future members of your working group. Happy researching!
